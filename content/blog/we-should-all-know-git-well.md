Version control's mega important.
I bet you used it even at school, saving stuff as `important-thing-VERSION-4.doc`

There's so much to learn about git. And most of us could afford to know a bit more about how it works.

- `reflog` has saved my life many times
- shortcuts like `git checkout -` save loads of time
- [completion scripts](https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/contrib/completion) can make your life easier & show options you didn't know about

If you don't already, it's probably worth curating a `~/.gitconfig` that you check into... `git`... and store somewhere.
