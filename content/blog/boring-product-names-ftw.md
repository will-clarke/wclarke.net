In a company I worked at recently, we released a fantastic shiny-new thing.
It was a smaller version of another product called \`cargo\`, which did something related to packaging.

The question is, what should we call it?
Here are some names we came up with:

-   `parcel`
-   `package`
-   `freight`
-   `cargo-mini`
-   `gateway`
-   `specific-and-boring-product-description`
-   `catalyst`

Any guesses which are the best names?

Our developers and users already knew about `cargo`. They had the mental context in their head. Because of this, `cargo-mini` makes sense as a smaller version of `cargo`.
I'm quite a fan of absurdly verbose but specific names, so I'm also a fan of `specific-and-boring-product-description`
