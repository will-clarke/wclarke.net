### [Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Ruby-1-9-2-0-Programmers/dp/1937785491/?tag=wilclasblo-21)

The 'pickaxe' book is a complete overview to Ruby. It's a pretty hefty book, covering these topics:

- A great tutorial on using Ruby.
- The definitive reference to the language.
- Complete documentation of all built-in classes, modules, and methods.
- Complete descriptions of all 97 standard libraries.

Ruby likes objects and 'POODR' shows how to make the most of them.
Modular code is easier to maintain, reuse and understand.
Sandi Metz has some interesting ideas on OOP - her [rules](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers) have become important.
We see the world in objects, and I think that code usually makes more sense in objects too.

### [Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Development with Rails](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ruby-Rails-Tutorial-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0134077709/?tag=wilclasblo-21)

This is a great introduction to Rails. It starts slow enough for complete n0obs, but has enough depth
to interest far more advanced programmers. It walks through TDD, getting to use the console and git,
and covers encryption, AJAX and how Rails works on a practical level.
There is also a free, online version of the book [here](https://www.railstutorial.org/book)

One of the best things about Ruby is its expressiveness and elegance.
Understanding how Ruby was designed to work helps you to really tap into its
power and makes a lot of things make a lot more sense.
