Amazon's famous _two-pizza rule_ says that a team should be big enough to share two pizzas.
I personally wouldn't be happy to share my pizza with ten other people.

Basecamp have teams of only [two or three people](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/4.1-appendix-02#small-enough-to-wing-it). This allows specialisation, reduces context-switching and allows for more teams in total. In coding terms, this is the single responsibility principle.

In order to have lots of teams, you need detailed domain knowledge. Where should the boundries be? This is exactly the same approach as domain design in a codebase, but at the team-level.

TL;DR Your team is probably too big.
