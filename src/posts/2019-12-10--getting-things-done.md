Technology is a lever. It lets us do things.

As Steve Jobs said:

> Man is a toolmaker, has the ability to make a tool to amplify the amount of inherent ability that he has.

The whole point of technology is that it let's us **do** things.

As a software engineer, it can be tempting to fall into the trap of spending loads of time optimising your developer environments.

- Which shiny new thing should I use?
- Is there a vim plugin to save me 3 seconds per day?
- Can I [automate a coffee machine from my terminal?](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts)

These are all loads of fun, and you learn loads by doing them... but the end result is just that you'll be better at doing a (potentially very specific) job in the future.

Technology can impact every facet of our lives for enormous good. We have the ability to improve the world **loads**... and there's more to technology than just a slick development environment.

Maybe try finishing that side-project, or sitting down and thinking what you really want to **achieve**, rather than **how**.
