`git log` is fairly useful.

It's even more useful with a few other commands:

`git log --all` - Include all branches in output
`git log --graph` - Include visual depiction of branchesall branches in output
`git log --oneline` - This is kinda self-explanatory.
`git log --decorate` - Show branches
`git log ..branch` & `git log master..` - These commands can help you find the differences between branches.
