You can see your last commands by:

1. Pressing `:` (which is hopefully mapped to just `;`)
2. `<ctrl-p>` ('previous' in many unix applications)
   You can also press `up` if you find this easier... although you shouldn't...

Another way is to press `q:`, which provides a list of your recent commands. You can `k` your way through them and open (`<cr>`) them.
