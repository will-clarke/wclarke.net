You're likely to spend a significant percentage of your waking life working. You may as well try to enjoy it.

Money's kinda pointless if you're miserable earning and spending it.

If you're doing something you don't like, you should seriously consider making a change.

You can:

- try to change your teams
- try to change your hours
- try to change your hour-flexibilty
- try to change your jobs
- try to change your company
- try to change your projects
- try to change your managers
- try to change your industries
- try to change the technology you work with
- try to learn more stuff
- try to change your perspectives:
  - try to get more interested with what you do on a day-to-day way
  - try to engage more with your company's **product**
  - try to engage more with your company's **decisions**
  - try to take more ownership over what you're doing. A wrong decision may be better than no decision at all.

Life should be fun. Play around a bit and don't take anything toooo seriously. Enjoy it!
