title: Show Vim Mappings
---

Vim has a helpful command to show all your mappings:

`:map`

This lists all your mappings. You can extend this:

If you wanted to find all your leader mappings,
`:map <leader>`
would return a list of them.

You can use this to find spare bindings & avoid overwriting important ones!
