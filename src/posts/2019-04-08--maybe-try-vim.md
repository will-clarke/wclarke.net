`vim` people like to talk about `vim` and often don't shut up about it.

It takes a long time to learn & adapt to modal editing and all of `vim`'s esoteric keybindings.

Despite that, it's really popular. Perhaps people are onto something?

If you edit text for a living, it's probably worth your while looking into learning the basics of `vim` properly (no arrow keys, that's cheating!).
