[OpenAI](https://openai.com) have created a model that produces text. Given some
input text, it will create some intelligent guesses about subsequent text.

It's easy to sign up to have access and play around ([link here](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/)).

This is only going to get exponentially better. Soon it'll be way better than
any humans so we'll all be out of a job.. but at least we'l have some amazing
books to read during our post-scarcity utopian lives.

I was mucking around with it and tried to see if it could generate any new blog
posts for me. Here are the ones it suggested:

```md
# How to convert a String to a number in JavaScript

# Feel conflicted about something? Take some time off!

# OMG! How to make an app store?

# Have a backup plan
When something goes wrong, the best thing is often just to have a plan B. That way if things go awry, you’ve got a backup idea up your sleeve. business marketing sales strategy work worklife balance

Which is exactly the sort of nonsense I'd talk about.

Some more title suggestions:

```md
A fun editor

The Evils of the Global Inheritance
Permissions By Group
export a variable in bash
Docker: List Containers
```

My favourite is `The Evils of the Global Inheritance`
