You've probably heard people telling you to find more time to focus on something
closely. Block out time in your calendar so you can do deep work. It's good advice.

Spending time looking at something in detail is like using a magnifying glass;
you can see a small area in high resolution. Magnifying glasses are useful, but
they do limit our ability to see broadly. I think it's also worth looking
through an opposite type of lense, a minifying glass (if that's a thing);
something that makes everything look small, with much lower resolution, but far
broader scope.

There's no point in having a beautiful component that just doens't fit in with
the larger machinery.
