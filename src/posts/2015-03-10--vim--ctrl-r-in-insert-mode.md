title: 'Vim: Ctrl-R in Insert Mode'
---

`ctrl-r` in **Insert Mode** is pretty useful.

It inserts text based on your current vim context.

Many of these commands work with registers, so it may be worth getting your head round those....

Ctrl-R Shortcut | What it does
-----------|------------
`ctrl-r %` | inserts filename
`ctrl-r :` | inserts last command
`ctrl-r /` | inserts last search
`ctrl-r =` | inserts evaluated sum (eg. 2+3)
`ctrl-r [a-z 0-9 key]` | inserts text from register


Hope they help!
