# Starting Vim

Using Vim & TMUX feels like it makes you faster after a couple of weeks.

It does take a while to get used to it.

Although I've read loads of contradictory advice, I think that it's best to get started with a well-defined set-up. YADR is the one that I like.

If you're unsure about trying vim, you could start a mini-turorial on your unix machine with

    vimtutor

It's a great resource to learn the basic motions & get the feel of Vim.
