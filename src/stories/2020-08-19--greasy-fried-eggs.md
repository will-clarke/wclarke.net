Tim was still ravenous. He felt like he hadn't eaten anything for years.
An urgent craving for something hot and greasy was all he could focus on. Something, anything, to fill him up and replenish his growling stomach.

On his plate in front of him were two fried eggs.
Tim shovelled the first egg into his mouth without a second's pause. He didn't admire the perfectly cooked yolk, the crisp edge or the gleam of oil on the egg-white. He inhaled without any enjoyment or satisfaction, frantically, almost desperately as he tried to fulfil his hunger.

The second egg met a similar fate, demolished by a fanatically insatiable Tim who barely noticed.

Tim moved onto the next plate, unaware of his surroundings. These new eggs didn't appease Tim, either. He gripped his fork harder and plunged the contents of the next plate into his mouth in two well-rehearsed movements.

Midway through the following plate, for a split second, Tim had a surge of self-awareness. A sudden lucidity he hadn't felt for ages. How many eggs had he eaten? He had know idea. Tens? Hundreds? Thousands?

Tim was still ravenous. He felt like he hadn't eaten anything for years.
