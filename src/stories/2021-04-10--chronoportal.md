The Chronoportal experiments had failed before. They had all imploded in large explosions, far more violent than predicted, which had left the theoretical physicists scratching their head. JUPITER's Nanotechnology and Quantum Research Arm were now testing the most up-to-date iteration.

They had made this version out of a reinforced self-hardening tungsten alloy.

Sam programmed the boot sequence. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1.
Sam was suddenly vaporised. Every living creature within a 25-mile radius died.

The radiation-resistant robots that inspected the site after the tragedy discovered strange remains. At the centre of the catastrophe, the rescue droids found fragments of distinct structures.

They unearthed a metal frame made of an alloy that scientists were able to identify but had no idea how to synthesise.
Other organic lattices
, organic lattices and alien crystals. The metal structure was almost completely destroyed while the organic lattice and strange crystals were less harmed. There were three golden orbs around the same size as footballs which scientists determined was some rugged way to store information.

The portal looked like it was now broken, but it could have been working for hundreds of years.
