By the time you read this I'll be dead. Completely dead. With no chance of returning.

I'm about to carry out certain actions that you will do doubt find abhorrent. These were not done thoughtlessly or in a fit of passion. I've agonised over my decision for longer that you'll ever know. You have NO IDEA how hard it was.
Both selfishly and selflessly, I'm confident that it's the right thing to do, the most humane thing to do. And yet it'll still be by far the hardest thing I've ever had to do. By far.

I want to give you, the reader, a simple warning. Modern society has thrived by perpetuating certain damaging lies and I'd like a chance to focus on some of these. You have doubtless been primed - through a lifetime of enculturation - to reject my insights, but I'm confident that if you'll indulge me, you'll find some hidden grains of truth in what I have to say.

I'm about to euthanize my 13 children. I don't mean them any harm. I just want their suffering - and mine - to end.

Five years ago I was in a major traffic accident. The details are unimportant. The moment of impact was the only **real** experience in my life. My consciousness transcended my earthly body. I saw the world in a way that no meditation, no hallucinogens would allow. A sliver of brilliance in a dark & brittle universe. I saw pain. I understood pain. I understood my pain. And my ancestors. It was raw.

I instantly understood a profound truth about the human condition. Pain is worse than pleasure is good. It defines us. You are shaped by your pain. Your aspirations are ultimately just pain-avoidance. It may have been a nasty trick for Evolution to play on us, but it's turned out to be effective.

Pleasure doesn't exist. It's merely the absence of pain. Modern philosophy exacerbates it. "Only think positive thoughts". Hide from the reality.

In that instant I understood the human condition, the human consciousness. I understood the genetic heritability of...

If I were a braver man I would try to euthanize more than just my children. But I'll settle for saving my descendants from untold lifetimes of pain.
