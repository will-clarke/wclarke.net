title: Joe's Hardened Thermal Filter

Joe's hands trembled with excitement. His experiment currently sitting in a tub of liquid helium had the potential to revolutionise human energy production. All the other scientists had laughed, said he was wasting his time. They said that thermodynamics were well understood and that there was no known material that would withstand the heat and pressure of what he was trying to achieve.

To begin with, they had been right, of course. But that was before Joe's decade-long private research into quantum hardening.

His original breakthrough theoretical material had superb quantum-filtering properties. This meant that it acted like a sieve and could, over time, separate subatomic particles with high energy levels from those with lower energy levels. This theoretical material should be able to divide a beaker of lukewarm water into two sections, one hot and one cold. If this were possible in the physical world, it would eliminate any energy needs humanity could conceivably have. Of course, it would also open up new possibilities for creating weapons of mass destruction. Joe hadn't spent much time thinking about this; he was too focused on the engineering and scientific challenges to worry about the ethical impact on such a powerful invention. He would settle for his name being remembered forever and his invention carrying humanity to distant stars.

His second discovery, just as monumental as his first, was that it was possible to construct a material that could withstand any theoretical heat or pressure. Its quantum structure actually hardened the more pressure was exerted on it. He originally thought it could help fusion-reactors achieve a higher temperature, but then thought of his quantum-filtering.

Joe had spent a couple of years trying to merge his two discoveries together and bring them into the physical world. Superconductive printing wasn't particularly advanced, but it seemed just good enough for what he wanted.

Joe had started printing his hardened thermal filter over a week ago. He had printed it in a blast-proof tank of liquid helium. It had just finished.
The device looked like a shiny ping-pong ball. It was just sitting, tantalisingly, in the tank, doing nothing.

To Joe's disappointment, the temperature of the tank wasn't changing. He'd expected to be able to sense the liquid helium getting colder. He had also printed the device aroudnd a wireless temperature sensor. The sensor was exactly the same temparature.
Joe grew steadily more irritated watching the sensors. After watching them for five hours, he slunk off in a rage to get some fresh air and find some food.
As he was walking in the secluded wood around his house, he phone went off. A tiny temperature difference had been detected!

When Joe had raced back to the lab, the temperarture difference was larger. After another few minutes, the temperature differece was approaching half a degree Kelvin; the liquid helium tank was now colder than it had been and the inside of the device was warmer.

Joe collapsed with exhaustion at his desk when the temperature difference was around one whole Kelvin.

He woke up hours later feeling freezing. As he opened his eyes groggily he noticed frozen condensation around his lab equipment. Typical. Some of his lab equipment had malfunctioned at the crux of this experiment. Perhaps it was his cryogenic distillation compressor? Oh well. At least the experiment would be repeatable. It had worked!!! The sphere had showed an entire degree's temperature differential! An entire degree! He'd privately hoped for perhaps 10 millikelvins.

Curious, Joe tapped a few keys at his computer terminal and brought up the history of the experiment while he'd been asleep. He spent a full quarter of a minute stupidly trying to interpret the results. Great. His callibration had also broken. Apparently the temperature difference between the inside of the sphere and the tank had been more than 500 degrees before the sensors broke.

A flash of adrenaline, equal parts excitement and panic, rushed through Joe. Could this actually have worked? Had it actually been wildly successful? He'd known that the quantum-hardened material was tough, but couldn't comprehend how it hadn't broken down by now.

The liquid helium tank was virtually at absolute zero; it couldn't really get any colder. The sphere had apparently 'sucked' heat out of not just the tank, but also the insulated equipment designed to maintain constant temperature. The frost looked like it was spreading. Fast.

Joe turned all the heating he had on and aimed the portable burners at the encroaching frost. The heat made little difference.

After three days the frost zone had taken over the room. It was visibly spreading slowly.

After a week, the frost had engulfed Joe's entire lab building. Terrified, Joe had contacted the police, imploring them to do something. The frost was creeping at a slow walking pace and still showed no signs of slowing down.

A couple of days later the military witnessed half the woods freezing. The cold crystals were spreading faster than a person could run. The military began launching missles at the heart of the frozen lab. Nothing seemed to stop, or even slow the inevitable and accelerating march of the frost across the woods. The missiles, if anything, somehow seemed to speed it up.

After two week the frost had encroached one hundred miles in every direction. The world governments, scientiests and media had no idea what to do. Was this some new terrorist weapon? How much further would it spread? Dozens of brave firefighters and soldiers had trudged into the wasteland, but none made it more than a few feet, even in heated veichles and clothing. Jet planes froze and fell out of the sky. Missiles still could hit the lab, but they needed to be launched using old-fashioned technology; the new self-propelled missiles would freeze up quickly. The only way to reach the lab was through mortar-type rockets that were un-guided and just whizzed through the air in a parobolic curve.
Global hysteria reigned.

The milirary detonated their first nuclear warhead. Like the missiles, the nuclear bomb did nothing to slow the ever-accellerating march of the frost. Thousands had been frozen in their own homes, unable to evacuate in time. Even people who had somehow managed to board airoplanes directly away from the calamity perished; the frost overtook the aeroplanes.

A month after Joe's inital experiment left the entire planet a lifeless frozen desert.
