<!-- Matt is packing for a journey. All normal, art I'm our universe. Some things don't quite add up. Passes out.  -->
<!-- Reached our light speed intergalactic voyage. Hibernation and brain stimulation has been stopped.  -->
<!-- Brain stimulation to keep brain active and not decay.  -->
<!-- Work to do. New colonisation to do.  -->

Matt blearily looked at the road ahead. They'd been travelling for a long time and the Citroen's petrol was running low. It was Sam's turn to drive and Matt let the warmth and vibrations of the car lull him back to sleep.

Matt woke up. As the cryogenic numbness slowly faded, he remembered where he was. It was his turn to maintain the ship. They were still two light-years away. Sam was hibernation stats were all normal.

Matt stood up. The brain stimulation had left him with some strange cryo-dreams. He shook off some wistful thought about his old life on Earth and went back to work.
