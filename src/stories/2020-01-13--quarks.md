Jeff's new quantum research was revolutionary. He'd discovered a new way to observe the smallest-known subatomic particles in high resolution.

He had split the last three years of his life in two; during the day he'd played around with expensive and bulky hardware. During the night he'd refined his image-processsing algorithm. His lab was a mess of computer screens, liquid helium canisters, mirrors, large lenses and a periphory of bulky electornic equipment.

Jeff logged in to his super-computer cluster. He had primed his liquid helium tanks and the delecately angled sensors were currently just 3Â°K. He nervously typed a command onto his greasy keyboard and hit enter.
As soon as he'd pressed the button, some unassuming text popoped up on screen

```
IMAGING SUCCESS

Jeff held his breath. A bead of sweat fell on his keyboard.
He'd never seen this success message before. Maybe it had worked!!

A previously-black computer monitor went gray. Either the program had crashed, or he'd assumed the wrong vibration frequency - the particles could be vibrating too fast for his screen.
Jeff frantically mashed two keys to tell the cluster that he wanted to slow the playback on the monitor by another 1000 times. The screen flashed once and was gray again.

Still not breathing, Jeff slowed the recording again and again until the vibrating particles came into focus. He zoomed in to one particle and slowed the recording right down again.
Suddenly the particle disappeared.
Jeff rewinded and slowed down the playback even more.
There was a large explosion which caused the quark to disappear with a bright flash overwhelming the screen. In the quarks place there was a rapidly expanding and dissipating into a sort of dust. This overthrew some of fundamental theories about particle physics. The dust gradually settled, condensing into small bright dots that continued to attract more dust and grow brighter.

Jeff stepped back, amazed. He couldn't believe the results of his experiment. Someone must have tampered with his devices; he must have overlooked some fundamental part of it. At first glance it looked like that quark was simulating the universe. He'd seen what looked like the big-bang. And there was some definite galaxy formation there too.
This was the most incredible discovery of the century. It would overthrow all of known physics. It couldn't possibly be true. Before he allowed himself to give into his almost-unbearable excitement, he leaned back in his chair and wondered whether this could actually be true. Was his testing equipment all working correctly? Could his computer be infected with malware? Could Matt have pulled another of his 'funny' pranks? The last one, pretending to delete a week's worth of data, hadn't been amusing in the slightest.
No, Matt wouldn't have bothered to animate the start of the universe within his experiment. That would have taken hundreds of hours.

Jeff leaned back in his chair. Suppose, for arguments sake, that this experiment was correct. Suppose that the quarks were universes.
Did that mean there were an infinite number of concurrent universes? Could they all be the same one? Could it be some sort of self-referencing universe? Could the ridiculous one-electron universe theory actually be an underestimate?

Was Jeff's universe just a minuscule part of another giant universe? And was that one a minuscule part of another one? How far did it go? Had he just discovered another spacial dimension? Had he just witnessed multiverses? Were there an infinite number of Jeffs looking at a computer screen amazed at his new results?
What did this mean for consciousness? Was it infinite too? Even after the universe cooled down & entropy won, were they doomed to be reborn after the next big bang? Again and again and again and again? Was there no hope of escape?

Jeff groaned. He was stunned. He could do nothing but stare vacantly ahead.

Then he saw the camera and heard the laughing outside.
