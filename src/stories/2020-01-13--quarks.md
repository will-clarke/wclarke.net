Jeff's new quantum research was revolutionary. He'd discovered a dramatically better way to observe the smallest-known subatomic particles, quarks.

On his computer screen he saw the quarks vibrating impossibly fast. Jeff had anticipated this; most matter in the universe seemed to move slowly when in a large group but faster the more you zoomed into it.
He had managed to record a nanosecond of high-definition footage. Jeff typed a command on his computer and this recorded nanosecond played back at a millionth of the speed. This playback was far too short to make anything of but it was a useful to show that the recording had worked.

Jeff slowed the recording down by a billion times; the nanosecond was now stretched out to 15 minutes. This let him see the vibrating.
Having watched the particle for a quarter of an hour, Jeff reprocessed the playback to its slowest setting; a quadrillion times slower than.
He noticed that the quark was behaving bizarrely. Zooming in as far as he could, he watched some of the recording.

There was a large explosion which caused the quark to disappear with a bright flash overwhelming the screen. In the quarks place there was a rapidly expanding and dissipating into a sort of dust. This overthrew some of fundamental theories about particle physics. The dust gradually settled, condensing into small bright dots that continued to attract more dust and grow brighter.

Jeff stepped back, amazed. He couldn't believe the results of his experiment. Someone must have tampered with his devices; he must have overlooked some fundamental part of it. At first glance it looked like that quark was simulating the universe. He'd seen what looked like the big-bang. And there was some definite galaxy formation there too.
This was the most incredible discovery of the century. It would overthrow all of known physics. It couldn't possibly be true. Before he allowed himself to give into his almost-unbearable excitement, he leaned back in his chair and wondered whether this could actually be true. Was his testing equipment all working correctly? Could his computer be infected with malware? Could Matt have pulled another of his 'funny' pranks? The last one, pretending to delete a week's worth of data, hadn't been amusing in the slightest.
No, Matt wouldn't have bothered to animate the start of the universe within his experiment. That would have taken hundreds of hours.

Jeff leaned back in his chair. Suppose, for arguments sake, that this experiment was correct. Suppose that the quarks were universes.
Did that mean there were an infinite number of concurrent universes? Could they all be the same one? Could it be some sort of self-referencing universe? Could the ridiculous one-electron universe theory actually be an underestimate?

Was Jeff's universe just a minuscule part of another giant universe? And was that one a minuscule part of another one? How far did it go? Had he just discovered another spacial dimension? Had he just witnessed multiverses? Were there an infinite number of Jeffs looking at a computer screen amazed at his new results?
What did this mean for consciousness? Was it infinite too? Even after the universe cooled down & entropy won, were they doomed to be reborn after the next big bang? Again and again and again and again? Was there no hope of escape?

Jeff groaned. He was stunned. He could do nothing but stare vacantly ahead.

Then he saw the camera and heard the laughing outside.
