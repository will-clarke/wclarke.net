Tim is making tea. He's pouring boiling water into the pot when suddenly time stops.

God rolls his eyes. This'll be a faff to sort out. He saves and restarts the simulation and while he waits, he goes to make a quick cup of Earl Grey. God drums his fingers impatiently. After what seems like an eternity, the simulation's ready to go and God presses Play.

Tim's teapot is filling up.
