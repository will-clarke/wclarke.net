** Get things done > tech used :tech:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: getting-things-done

Technology is a lever. It lets us do things.

As Steve Jobs said:
> Man is a toolmaker, has the ability to make a tool to amplify the amount of inherent ability that he has.


{{< youtube 4x8wTj-n33A >}}



The whole point of technology is that it let's us *do* things.

As a software engineer, it can be tempting to fall into the trap of spending loads of time optimising your developer environments.

- Which shiny new thing should I use?
- Is there a vim plugin to save me 3 seconds per day?
- Can I [[https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts][automate a coffee machine from my terminal?]]

These are all loads of fun, and you learn loads by doing them... but the end result is just that you'll be better at doing a (potentially very specific) job in the future.

Technology can impact every facet of our lives for enormous good. We have the ability to improve the world *loads*... and there's more to technology than just a slick development environment.

Maybe try finishing that side-project, or sitting down and thinking what you really want to *achieve*, rather than *how*.

** Defaults are good. Try them out! :tips:unix:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: defaults-are-good
:EXPORT_DATE: 2019-08-10
:END:

Most defaults have been carefully thought out. It's worth at least looking over them before deciding that they're useless & old-fashioned.

While it's true that many defaults are the result of some old-fashioned constraints (eg. =QWERTY= keyboard or the vim homerow being one key to the left), it may be worth your time just accepting their flawed premises and trying to use them anyway. There's value if people are also using them.

If your vim config is totally unique to you (or you're a =dvorak= user), you'll have a hard time pairing with someone else or =SSH=-ing into a server.

The creators of customisable products have hopefully thought long and hard about the best way to use *their* creations. They'll be far more invested in making it work well than you will and they'll have a vision of how they want their products being used.

Sometimes it's sensible to just accept defaults.

** Boring product names FTW :tech:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: boring-product-names-ftw

:END:
In a company I worked at recently, we released a fantastic shiny-new thing.
It was a smaller version of another product called `cargo`, which did something related to packaging.

The question is, what should we call it?
Here are some names we came up with:
- =parcel=
- =package=
- =freight=
- =cargo-mini=
- =gateway=
- =specific-and-boring-product-description=
- =catalyst=

Any guesses which are the best names?

Our developers and users already knew about =cargo=. They had the mental context in their head. Because of this, =cargo-mini= makes sense as a smaller version of =cargo=.
I'm quite a fan of absurdly verbose but specific names, so I'm also a fan of =specific-and-boring-product-description=

** Document EVERYTHING!!!
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: document-everything
:EXPORT_DATE: 2019-06-08
:END:

People leave jobs all the time. People get run over by busses or win the lottery. People forget stuff.

It's important to document things, especially technical things.

#+BEGIN_SRC
code != documentation
#+END_SRC

Source code explains *how* things work... it's simply telling the computer the algorithm you want run.
What's not often mentioned is wider context.

- Why do we want this thing at all?
- What problem does it solve?
- Why don't we approach this in a different way?
- What are the current constraints? Is there time / business / financial pressure?
- Is this meant to be scalable or an MVP?
- What does this object / table represent?

Use comments and documentation widely to make it easier for the next person - often you.

** Cron is cool
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: document-everything
:EXPORT_DATE: 2019-06-08
:END:
Cron jobs have a slightly terrifying syntax.
But there are loads of easy online [[https://crontab-generator.org/][tools like this one to help.]]

It can be really useful to have background jobs doing all sorts of things in the background.

The whole point of computers is to automate stuff... and =cron= is a really easy UNIX-y way of doing this.

Disclaimer: For one-off scripts, cron jobs can be great...but it doesn't scale particularly well. Eg. if you need to syncronise lots of background jobs, it's probably better to look for something else.

** Automate Repetitive Tasks
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: automate-repetitive-tasks
:EXPORT_DATE: 2019-05-02
:END:

Computers are good at doing boring things.
Humans are too, but humans are also good at doing other, more interesting and creative things.

In every job I've been at, there have always been loads of ways to save human time by telling a computer to do some stuff instead of doing it manually.
This is especially true for non-super-technical areas; there could be lots of delicious low-hanging fruit.

You don't even need to be able to code to do loads of stuff; services like [[https://ifttt.com/][IFTTT]] or [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/][Google sheets]] have lots of automatable functionality baked in.

In the past I've save loads of time by completely automating:
- Sending daily emails to clients about latest statistics (with some top-level analysis)
- Creation & management of Adwords campaigns
- Daily parsing of reports (& inserting into a database)

https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time_2x.png

The trick here is to pick your battles. Some tasks are easy to automate (those which involve structured data). Others are difficult.
But always remember to keep tabs on where you spend your time; you may be able to free up a lot of time by some simple automation!

** Maybe try vim
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: maybe-try-vim
:EXPORT_DATE: 2019-04-08
:END:
=vim= people like to talk about =vim= and often don't shut up about it.

It takes a long time to learn & adapt to modal editing and all of =vim='s esoteric keybindings.

Despite that, it's really popular. Perhaps people are onto something?

If you edit text for a living, it's probably worth your while looking into learning the basics of =vim= properly (no arrow keys, that's cheating!).

** TODO We should all know git
:PROPERTIES:

:EXPORT_DATE: 2019-03-08
:END:

Version control's mega important.
I bet you used it even at school, saving stuff as =important-thing-VERSION-4.doc=

There's so much to learn about git. And most of us could afford to know a bit more about how it works.

- =reflog= has saved my life many times
- shortcuts like =git checkout -= save loads of time
- [[https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/contrib/completion][completion scripts]] can make your life easier & show options you didn't know about

If you don't already, it's probably worth curating a =~/.gitconfig= that you check into... =git=... and store somewhere.
